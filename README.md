# Docker Game Servers

### Docker all the things
A lightweight set of docker compose files for easy deploy on an OCI ARM64 VPS

## Rationale & Feature-set
While many dashboards exist, I wanted to keep overheads as low as possible for the ARM node, while making management nicer than the legible-if-you-happen-to-be-me set of [bash scripts](https://github.com/KenjiE20/minecraft-scripts) I built up initially.
